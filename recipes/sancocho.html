        <h4>How to make Dominican Sancocho</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Trim the excess fat of the meat and rinse well with lemon juice or vinegar. </li>
            <li>To season the meat, add 1 teaspoon dry adobo, ½ teaspoon ground black pepper, 1 teaspoon oregano and <a href=https://mydominicankitchen.com/homemade-latin-sofrito-seasoning><strong>sofrito</strong></a>. Mix it all together to coat the meat well. </li>
            <li>In a <strong>6 qts pot or caldero</strong>, heat up oil over medium high heat. Add the meat to the pot, and sear until brown all around. Cover the pot with a lid and lower the heat to medium. Let the meat cook until tender, about 30 - 40 minutes. Be sure to add water as needed throughout so that the meat doesn’t burn. Remove the meat from the pot and set it aside for later.</li>
            <li>While the meat cooks, peel and cut the vegetables into 1-inch pieces, except for the squash, which you want to peel and cut into two large pieces. </li>
            <li>Add all the vegetables to the pot and add water until you’ve filled ¾ of the pot. Bring to a boil. Do not overfill the pot because you will be adding in the meat later. </li>
            <li>When the water begins to boil, add the chicken bouillon and allspice or malagueta. Let it cook for about 15 - 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>When the squash is tender, remove it from the pot and blend it with ½ cup of liquid from the pot and ½ cup of cool water until the mixture is smooth. Then, pour it back into the pot. </li>
            <li>Using cooking twine, tie together tightly cilantro, culantro (cilantro ancho), and thyme and add it to the pot. Let it simmer on medium heat for about 20 more minutes. </li>
            <li>Stir in ½ teaspoon of adobo, ½ teaspoon of oregano, red pepper flakes, salt and pepper to taste. </li>
            <li>Add the meat back into the pot and let it all simmer until the vegetables are tender, about 10 - 20 minutes.</li>
            <li>With a colander, remove the herbs bundle we added earlier and the malagueta. </li>
            <li>Stir in freshly squeezed lime juice before serving.</li>
            <li>Serve warm with <a href=https://mydominicankitchen.com/how-to-cook-white-rice><strong>white rice</strong></a> and avocado.</li>
